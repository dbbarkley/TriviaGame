What the project does:

This is a Guardians of the Galaxy themed trivia game. Once the user starts the game I dynamically add a list of questions with a countdown timer set for 60 seconds. Once the timer hits 0, or the user clicks 'done' I dynamacally remove the list of questions and show how many the user answered Correct, Incorrect, and Unanswered.

Why the project is useful:

I didn't want to have everything written in HTML so I wrote the majority of the code to be added dynamically when a event happens. I'm using Jquery and Javascript to change the layout and texts without refreshing the page. Media queries set for 768px, 580px, and 400px.

Who maintains and contributes to the project:

Myself.
